hfn FN Interpreter
==================

This directory contains the source code for hfn, an interpreter for the FN
Programming Language. hfn is written in the Haskell programming language. To
learn more about FN, consult the FN Doc GitHub repository which may be cloned
with

    git clone https://www.github.com/fnlang/fndoc.git


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for hfn currently does not exist outside of a physical notebook
which can be found on the author's desk. Work is underway to transfer the
contents of said notebook to a more organized (and legible) series of LaTeX
documents, which will eventually be available on the FN Doc GitHub repository.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

hfn does not have an executable target presently. Its source files can be
compiled with the Glaskell Haskell Compiler, <https://www.haskell.org/ghc/>. hfn
does not depend upon any libraries aside from the ghc Prelude, which is included
with ghc.
